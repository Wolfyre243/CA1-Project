                        <br><br>
                        These are just a few examples of the extreme climates that drive people
                        out of their homes. Not only that, climate change has had a great impact
                        on food production across the globe.
                        <br><br>
                        This leads to decreased quantities and the quality of nutritious food
                        being produced, hence affecting the food supply. This effect is further amplified
                        in Africa, as they are unable to grow their own crops sustainably due to poor 
                        conditions.

                <p>
                    Both a cause and an effect of hunger, conflict plays a major role
                    in the crisis of world hunger.
                    <br>
                    More than 85% of people experiencing hunger live in cities tainted with conflict,
                    caused by disputes over food and water.
                    <br>
                    Moreover, conflicts disrupt harvests, decreasing crop yield and
                    hence slowing down food production as a whole.
                    <br><br>
                    Many conflict zones in the world are in need of humanitarian aid,
                    yet both parties who are taking part in the conflict may block off 
                    relief operations from reaching starving populations.

                    <p>
                        People with power define those who eat and those who starve.
                        <br><br>
                        The world is an unequal one; marginalised people within communities such as
                        women, refugees, and those with disabilities are more likely to encounter
                        numerous barriers to essential services such as jobs and services, but most
                        importantly, supplies like food. 
                        <br><br>
                        Thus, inequality has led to chronic hunger around the world, which in turn has 
                        deepened the problem of inequality.

                <br>
                There are close to <strong>830 million</strong> lives at stake, and this number

                <br>
                There is no time like the present to act, hence the initiation of the 
                second SDG, <strong>Zero Hunger</strong>.
                <br>
                Amidst this crisis, <strong>YOU</strong> have a part to play too.
                <br>

                As you can see, World Hunger is a serious issue in modern society.
                <br>
                With more than <strong>25,000 people dying every day</strong> to hunger,
                it is about time we started taking action.
                <br>
                Through the years, numerous efforts have been made in an attempt to
                curb the number of deaths to hunger, all a part of

                    The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) feeds the world's 
                    hungriest, most vulnerable people.
                    <br><br>
                    Some notable goals include aiming to feed <strong>150 million</strong>
                    people in 2024, delivering more than <strong>15 billion</strong> meals per
                    year.
                    <br>
                    Based on the problem of conflict in World Hunger, WFP provides food
                    assistance to those regions caught in such conflicts as a result of weak or corrupt governments.
                    Not only that, WFP also helps communities to relapse after conflict, helping
                    them to strengthen governments and providing supplies.
                    <br><br>
                    WFP also takes in monetary donations from the public to aid in feeding those
                    in need.
